# FSC.SimpleSingleton
SimpleSingleton is a thread-safe singleton pattern implementation in C# that allows registration and retrieval of singleton instances of any type. It ensures that only one instance of a particular type can be created and accessed at a time, providing a globally accessible point of access for these instances.
